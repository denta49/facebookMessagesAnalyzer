# facebookMessagesAnalyzer

Hi! 

Here You can find Facebook Messages Analyzer script which I've created. It allows You to import your JSON messages files (which You can download from your Facebook account) and analyze them. 

## Functionalities
For now Facebook Messages Analyzer let's You to:

<ol>
  <li>Count how many messages with exact person You have.</li>
  <li>Count how many of that messages have been sent by You and your friend.</li>
  <li>Give You percentages of sent messages.</li>
  <li>Look for exact word in all messages You or your friend sent and give You a plot when and as much that word had been used.</li>
</ol>
All setup's (e.g. patch for messages dir or what word You want to analyze) are in main function at the bottom.

## Further functionalities
I'm working on further functionalities that will allow You to analyze everything You want and see that on charts.

What's coming:
  <ol>
  <li>Looking for semantic fields that You specify by few words.</li>
  <li>Plotting every semantic field that You specify.</li>
  <li>Plotting semantic fields comparsion.</li>
  <li>Calculating regression of semantic fields that You specify and plotiing it (e.g. 'How much word "like" is dependent on word "Amy" in our chat?'</li>
  <li>UI for script made with Chromium</li>
  <li>Generating raport of informations and charts that You desire</li>
</ol>

See You soon!
